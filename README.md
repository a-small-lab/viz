# ceps-viz
Library of data visualization functions and themes for use in products by the Center for Economic and Policy Studies, Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia.

The goal is to develop `ceps-viz` into a stand-alone package. The data visualization tools in the package can then be called by any R script, simply by loading the package into memory using the syntax `library(ceps-viz)`.

This repo is currently under development.
